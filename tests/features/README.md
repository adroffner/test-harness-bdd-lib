BDD Feature Files: Scenarios
============================

A **BDD .feature** file drives the test **Scenario** by following its outline.
The python code must read the **.feature** file and execute its **steps** in order.

Directory: features
-------------------

This directory holds downloaded **BDD .feature** files from the **Test Manager**.
A **Test Analyst** must write python code to execute the _scenario_.

Cucumber Gherkin Feature Files
------------------------------

* (Gherkin Syntax)[https://docs.cucumber.io/gherkin/reference/]

These **BDD .feature** files use the _Gherkin syntax_ to outline the steps.
The files are usually limited to only one **Scenario** or **Scenario Outline**.
